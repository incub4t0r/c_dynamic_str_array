# Dynamic Arrays in C

This repo contains my c and header files to store and modify a heap array of strings. Mostly made for practice, but I will continue to update this as necessary.

## TODO

- [X] Update array code to handle variable length strings (I have a fix for this and have the code but havent pushed it yet.)

## Usage

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
